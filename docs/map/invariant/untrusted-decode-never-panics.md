# Untrusted decode never panics

## The fact

Every byte this library parses came from a server it does not control, so **no
decode path may panic, over-read, or loop unboundedly on arbitrary input** — it must
return a typed error. "Arbitrary" is stronger than "malformed": truncated,
self-contradictory, and hostile-but-well-formed inputs are all in scope, including
lengths that claim more than the buffer holds and counts that multiply into
unreachable sizes.

A decoder is therefore judged by two separate properties: it produces the right
pixels for good input (the oracle's job), and it produces an *error* for everything
else (this invariant's job). Passing the first says nothing about the second.

## Why it is cross-cutting

The sites share an input, not a call graph. Framing, the connect-sequence parsers,
the channel layer and the codecs are separate stacks reached at different phases —
but every one of them takes its length and count fields from the wire. A guard added
in one is invisible from the others, and the fix has no natural home: it is a
property of the whole untrusted surface.

## Territories it holds in

- [Wire framing primitives](../territory/wire-framing.md) — the widest surface:
  `frame_len` / `is_fastpath` / `ReadCursor` see every byte in the process.
- [Bitmap codecs](../territory/bitmap-codecs.md) — the deepest arithmetic.
- [EGFX graphics pipeline](../territory/egfx-graphics-pipeline.md) — surface and
  cache commands.
- [Virtual channels](../territory/virtual-channels.md) — chunk reassembly lengths.
- [Session loop & PDU dispatch](../territory/session-loop-dispatch.md) — the
  dispatcher that hands bytes to all of the above.
- [Pointer & cursor](../territory/pointer-cursor.md) — mask/stride arithmetic.
- [Verification harness](../territory/verification-harness.md) — the only territory
  that *enforces* rather than obeys it: proptest in the PR gate, cargo-fuzz nightly.

## What a violation looks like

A panic is the *visible* form: the host's task dies mid-session, which reads as a
crash bug rather than a protocol bug. The invisible form is worse and more common —
a length that passes a bounds check but selects the wrong region, so decode
succeeds and returns **plausible wrong pixels**. Nothing errors, nothing crashes,
and the only signal is a picture that is subtly wrong on one server.

Rust makes the memory-safety half a panic rather than a corruption, which is why
this invariant is stated as *availability* (a denial of service against a client
that trusts its server too much) rather than as memory safety.

## Discovery history

- **#97 → ADR-0008** — the decision that hand-written vectors cannot cover this
  input space, and that the property belongs in the gate.
- **#98** — proptest "decode never panics on arbitrary bytes" + round-trip
  properties, implemented first for the RLE decoder, running on stable in the PR
  gate.
- **#99** — coverage-guided `cargo-fuzz` on a nightly CI lane, because proptest's
  random sampling does not reach depth. Two automations for one property: that
  duplication *is* the discovery history.
- Prior art that made the risk concrete rather than theoretical: FreeRDP's
  rle/planar/clearcodec/nsc OOB CVEs (memory `rdp_decoder_robustness_refs`).

## Where it will recur

**If a function reads a length, count or offset from bytes it did not produce, it is
subject to this.** Two derivations, and the gap between them is the finding:

```sh
ls fuzz/fuzz_targets/                      # what is fuzzed
rg --files crates/justrdp-pdu/src -g '*.rs'   # what parses untrusted bytes
```

Today the first list is codec-shaped (11 targets) and the second is twice as long:
`gcc`, `mcs`, `x224`, `tpkt`, `ber`, `per`, `nego`, `share`, `update`, `dvc`, `svc`,
`displaycontrol` and `errinfo` parse wire bytes with **no fuzz target**. That is not
a claim that they are wrong — it is the statement that this invariant is currently
enforced on one half of its surface.

New decoder ⇒ a proptest no-panic property in the same PR (stable gate), and a fuzz
target in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/` — remembering that the fuzz lane is nightly, so the
target does not run on the day it lands.
